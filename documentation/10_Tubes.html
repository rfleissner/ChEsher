<h1>Module Tubes</h1>
<p>
This module creates a tubes data file out of a 2D T3 Scalar Mesh (*.t3s) (bottom elevation) and a 2D Line Set (*.i2s), whose lines represent tubes. The tubes data file can be used as input for construction work modelling in a Telemac simulation. The tubes are defined in flow direction by node IDs. The module takes the nearest nodes to the line end points, so it is not necessary to define exact coordinates of tubes start- and endpoint. The levels of the tapers are carried over from the elevation of the mesh nodes. Default values for relaxation, head loss coefficients, width and height of the construction work and an indicator specifying a check valve behaviour can be applied.

<h2>Example 10: Creating tubes data file</h2>

<p>
A tubes data file should be created from an existing mesh. Open the mesh from the examples folder with Blue Kenue&trade;. The mesh was created with Blue Kenue&trade; in addition to module <b>DXF2BK</b> and <b>Mesh</b>. Draw open lines representing the tubes reaching from upstream to downstream of the bridge. It is recommended to define more tubes of one bridge from left to right to keep the tubes data replicable. Define some default values for tubes data and give a file name for the tubes data file.

By pressing the <b>Let's go!</b> button the process is started. When the process is done, some information about the results is given.

The resulting tubes data file can now be adapted and applied to a simulation.
