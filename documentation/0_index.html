<h1>ChEsher - Documentation</h1>
<p><b>ChEsher</b> is an interface tool between CAD software and Blue Kenue that is a pre and post processing software for the TELEMAC-MASCARET system that is an integrated suite of solvers for use in the field of free-surface flow of hydraulic modeling.
The tool was created for engineering purposes as support to perform flood analysis to derive flood protection measures. There it is necessary to create a triangulated surface from the terrain that includes dams, structures, road corridors, embankments and, of course, the river bed. Such linear structures can be meshed with ChEsher out of profiles, where also the elevation of the mesh is interpolated from the profiles.
Often, terrain analysis and the planning process is done by CAD software. So it was helpful to create an interface to CAD software, that can transform CAD objects to formats, that can be red by Blue Kenue and that can transform Blue Kenue formats and results from the analysis back to CAD software.
When planning flood protection projects, the first step is to analyse the status quo of the flood. Then, flood protection measures are derived and the last step is to analyse the future flood state. For water law agencies the influence of protection measures in form of differences of the water surface and the change in flood areas between the actual and the future state are relevant. Therefore colour ranges of water surface differences often are less accurate and concrete values are demanded, which can be produced by ChEsher.

It is separated to various modules:</p>
<p>The <a href="1_DXF2BK.html">DXF2BK</a> module provides transformations from the DXF format to geometric objects that can be red by Blue Kenue.</p>
<p>The <a href="2_BK2DXF.html">BK2DXF</a> module transforms a 2D T3 Scalar Mesh to DXF format.
<p>The <a href="3_Mesh.html">Mesh</a> module creates channel meshes out of profiles and boundaries as well as breaklines if desired.
<p>The <a href="4_LandXML.html">LandXML</a> module transforms a 2D T3 Scalar Mesh to a LandXML surface that can be imported to a CAD program.
<p>The <a href="5_ScalarDXF.html">ScalarDXF</a> module creates a DXF raster with attributes of a 2D T3 Scalar Mesh, for example water depths or water surface differences.
<p>The <a href="6_VectorDXF.html">VectorDXF</a> module creates a DXF raster with vectors of a 2D T3 Vector Mesh, for example flow velocities.
<p>The <a href="7_CS.html">CS</a> module formats the control sections output file and creates a DXF file with the control sections.
<p>The <a href="8_2DM2BK.html">2DM2BK</a> module transforms the contents of a SMS Mesh File to a T3 Scalar Mesh and to 2D/3D Line Sets.

<h2>How to use the documentation</h2>

Each module is documented separately and an example is added. To implement most of the examples, it is necessary to run the Telemac 2d validation test case <b>donau</b> with the cas-files in the examples folder at first. The input files from all the examples can be found in the examples folder.
