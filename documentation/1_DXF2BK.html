<h1>Module DXF2BK</h1>
<p>
This module transforms objects from a DXF file to Blue Kenue files. The geometric entities can be from type

<ul>
<li>point,</li>
<li>line,</li>
<li>2d polyline and</li>
<li>3d polyline.</li>
</ul>

They can be converted to

<ul>
<li>Data Point Sets (*.xyz),</li>
<li>2D Line Sets (*.i2s) or</li>
<li>3D Line Sets (*.i3s),</li>
</ul>

which can be red by Blue Kenue. The geometric entities to be transformed can be selected by DXF layers.
</p>

<h2>Example 1: Converting DXF entities</h2>

<p>
Different geometric entities from a given DXF file should be transformed to Blue Kenue formats.
</p>
<p>
After starting ChEsher with the module <b>DXF2BK</b> the DXF file can be imported through the therefor designated line.
By pressing the button <b>add</b> rows in the table are displayed. The button <b>refresh</b> updates the rows with the layers of the DXF file. This also works, if the DXF file was changed meanwhile. Each row stands for a layer from the DXF file, where a file name for each layer has to be entered.

By pressing the <b>Let's go!</b> button the transformation is started. When the progress is done, some information about the converted geometric entities is given.

The converted geometric entities can now be loaded with Blue Kenue as shown in the following picture.
