<h1>Module ScalarDXF</h1>
<p>

When comparing results between different simulation cases, contour plots are mostly less accurate and concrete values are demanded, which can be produced with this module by extracting values from a given 2D T3 Scalar Mesh (*.t3s) on a rasterized grid. The module can also be used to extract values from a major and a minor mesh. For example, the water surface is the major mesh and the water depths are the minor mesh. Both scalar values are then extracted for each grid point.
<br>
The scalar values are written to a DXF file. The grid spacing can be selected for both x- and y-direction. A bound can be defined to just extract values in the given range. If <b>Use monochrome colors</b> is not checked, positive values are extracted in red, negative ones in green.
</p>

<h2>Example 5: Comparing results</h2>

<p>
The results from two simulation cases (case A and case B from the Telemac 2d validation test case <i>donau</i>) should be compared.
</p>
<p>
Open the results file from the test cases with Blue Kenue&trade; and save the last step from the water depths to a 2D T3 Scalar Mesh (ASCII SingleFrame) (*.t3s). Assign the mesh from case A to the major and the mesh from case B to the minor mesh. Assign grid spacing values and minimum and maximum values to be extracted, select a symbol for the grid points and give a name for the output file.

Start the process by pressing the <b>Let's go!</b> button. When the process is done, some information about the results is given.

The resulting DXF file can now be imported to a CAD software. The following picture shows a part from the domain with the grid values. The upper values are the water depths from the major mesh (case A) and the lower values are the water depths from the minor mesh (case B). The mesh in the background comes from a LandXML import after using module <b>LandXML.</b>
