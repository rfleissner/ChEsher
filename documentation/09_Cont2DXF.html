<h1>Module Cont2DXF</h1>
<p>
This module creates contour plots from 2D T3 Scalar Meshes (*.t3s) that can be saved as DXF file format. The contours are created for level ranges with different colours. Pre-defined levels can be applied for water depth, water surface difference, flow velocity and bottom shear stress. The levels can be loaded and saved as EnSim ColourScale File (*.cs1), which is used by Blue Kenue&trade;.<br>
The contour plots can be saved as filled contours or as isolines to a DXF file. A name for the DXF layer can be defined. If the option <b>create legend</b> is checked, a legend is created in the right bottom corner of the contour plot. Therefor, a title and a subtitle can be defined for the legend . 

</p>

<h2>Example 9: Creating a contour plot</h2>

<p>
A wather depth contour plot of the Telemac 2d validation test case donau (case A) should be saved to a DXF file by using the default levels for water depths.
</p>
<p>
Load the *.t3s file by use of the according line. By selecting <b>water depth</b> and clicking <b>set default</b> the default levels for water depths are applied. Define a DXF layer name, check the boxes for filled contours and isolines and define the output file names. Check the box <b>create legend</b> and insert title and subtitle for the legend.

The resulting DXF file can now be opened with a CAD software. The following picture shows a part of the domain with the contour plot.
