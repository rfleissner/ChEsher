<h1>Module CS</h1>
<p>
This module creates a formatted data file from the sections input and output files, that can further be processed by a spreadsheet software. The sections can also be extracted to a dxf file, where the names of the sections and the minimum and maximum flows are displayed.
The decimal points for the time steps and the flow can be varied. The size factor influences the symbol and text size in the dxf file. A flow prefix and suffix can be specified.
</p>

<h2>Example 7: Processing section results</h2>

<p>
The section results from the simulation case A from the Telemac 2d validation test case <b>donau</b> should be converted to a formatted text file and the sections should be converted to a dxf file.
</p>
<p>
Load the files by use of the according lines. Check the boxes for the desired results and give names for the results files.
