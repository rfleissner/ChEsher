<h1>Module LandXML</h1>
<p>
With this module a mesh 2D T3 Mesh (*.t3s) (e.g. bottom, water depth, water surface, etc.) can be converted to a TIN surface from the LandXML file format, which then can be loaded into a civil engineering software. There, the results can be evaluated and processed, flood area maps can be created or cross sections of the river and the foreland can be generated. The module offers a more flexible way for evaluating and processing results from a simulation.

<h2>About LandXML</h2>
<p>
LandXML is a specialized XML data file format containing civil engineering and survey measurement data. The main goals are open design and survey data exchange. For more information visit <a href=http://www.landxml.org/>www.landxml.org.</a>
</p>
<h2>Example 3: Creating LandXML file</h2>

<p>
The bottom and the water surface from the Telemac 2d validation test case donau should be converted to a LandXML file. Open the results file from the validation test case <b>donau</b> (case A) with Blue Kenue and save the bottom and the last step from the water surface to a 2D T3 Scalar Mesh (ASCII SingleFrame) (*.t3s). Just select the input file, give the surface a name and choose an output filename.

By pressing the <b>Let's go!</b> button the transformation is started. When the progress is done, some information about the results is given.

The resulting LandXML files can now be imported to a civil engineering software to be analyzed and processed. The following picture shows a part from the domain with an alignment.
