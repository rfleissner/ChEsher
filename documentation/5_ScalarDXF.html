<h1>Module ScalarDXF</h1>
<p>
The influence of flood protection measures in form of differences of the water surface and the change in flood areas between the actual and the future state often are relevant. Therefore colour ranges of water surface differences are mostly less accurate and concrete values are demanded, which can be produced with this module. The module can also be used to extract values from a major and a minor mesh to a rasterized grid. For example, the water surface could be the major mesh and the water depths could be the minor mesh. Both scalar values are then extracted for each grid point.
<br>
The given grids have the 2D T3 Mesh (*.t3s) file format. The scalar values are written to a DXF file. The grid spacing can be selected for both x- and y-direction. A bound can be defined to just extract values in the given range. If <b>Use monochrome colors</b> is not checked, positive values are extracted in red, negative ones in green.
</p>

<h2>Example 5: Comparing results</h2>

<p>
The results from two simulation cases (case A and case B from the Telemac 2d validation test case <b>donau</b>) should be compared.
</p>
<p>
Open the results file from the test cases with Blue Kenue and save the last step from the water depths to a 2D T3 Scalar Mesh (ASCII SingleFrame) (*.t3s). Assign the mesh from case A to the major and the mesh from case B to the minor mesh. Assign grid spacing values and minimum and maximum values to be extracted, select a symbol for the grid points and give a name for the output file.

Start the process by pressing the <b>Let's go!</b> button. When the progress is done, some information about the results is given.

The resulting DXF file can now be imported to a CAD software. The following picture shows a part from the domain with the grid values. The upper values are the water depths from the major mesh (case A) and the lower values are the water depths from the minor mesh (case B). The mesh in the background comes from a LandXML import after using module <b>LandXML.</b>
